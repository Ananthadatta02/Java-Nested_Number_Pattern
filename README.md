# Java-Nested_Number_Pattern
This Java program prints a concentric square pattern of numbers based on the input size n. The outermost layer displays the highest number, with each inner layer decrementing by 1, forming a visually appealing nested pattern. Useful for practicing nested loops and pattern logic.
